# brainfarts-and-benchmarks 🧠⚡

This repository is a collection of **curiosity-driven coding experiments**.

It exists to capture those moments where a question pops up like:

- _“Why is this faster?”_
- _“Does this actually work?”_
- _“What happens if I try it this way?”_

Instead of letting those thoughts disappear, they live here.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This is **not** a production repository.
This is **not** a polished library.
This is **not** clean, reusable, or optimal by design.

This repository is about:

- learning by experimenting
- asking small, sometimes stupid questions
- benchmarking tiny details
- understanding _why_ something behaves the way it does

Every folder represents **one idea**.

Some ideas are useful.  
Some are questionable.  
Some exist purely because curiosity won.

---

## 📁 Structure

Each idea lives in its **own project folder**.

A typical project looks like this:

```

some-idea/
├── main.py | main.ipynb | main.js   # all actual code lives here
├── README.md                        # what was tested, why, and what was learned
└── (optional files)                 # notes, outputs, generated files

```

There is **no shared code** between projects.
Each folder is intentionally isolated so experiments remain simple and focused.

---

## 🔬 What lives here?

You’ll find things like:

- Python micro-benchmarks using `timeit`
- math and logic brainfarts
- “why did this work?” experiments
- performance comparisons
- small one-off scripts and notebooks

Languages may vary.
Quality may vary.
Curiosity is the only requirement.

## 🚫 What this repo is not

- ❌ a framework
- ❌ a tutorial series
- ❌ a best-practices guide
- ❌ a serious software project

If something here looks dumb — that’s probably the point.

---

## ✅ Why this exists

Because experimenting publicly is:

- how you learn faster
- how you remember _why_ things work
- how you build intuition
- how you stop being afraid of “wrong” code

This repo is a playground.  
Break things. Measure things. Ask “why”.

---

## ▶️ Running projects

Each project explains how to run it in its own `README.md`.

Most can be executed directly:

```bash
python main.py
```

or opened as a notebook.

## 🧠 Final note

If future-me is reading this:

Yes, some of this is ridiculous.
Yes, it was worth writing down.
